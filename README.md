# 🚨 SmartSafe Campus

**SmartSafe Campus** is a web-based **campus safety and emergency response system** designed to help students quickly report emergencies, share live location, and alert both campus authorities and personal emergency contacts.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

On many college campuses:
- Emergency reporting is slow and fragmented
- Students lack a quick way to share live location during distress
- Campus security often reacts *after* incidents occur
- No unified dashboard exists to monitor active SOS alerts

**SmartSafe Campus** addresses these gaps with a simple, fast, and practical solution.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

SmartSafe Campus provides:
- A **one-tap SOS system**
- **Live location sharing** using Google Maps
- An **admin-style dashboard** for monitoring alerts
- **Emergency contact notifications** with a clickable location link

The system is designed to be **lightweight, scalable, and hackathon-ready**, while reflecting real-world emergency workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 User Side
- 📍 Auto-detect or manually enter location
- 🚨 One-click SOS alert
- 📞 Add and save an emergency contact
- 💬 Send a pre-filled SOS message (WhatsApp/SMS) with live Google Maps location
- 🌐 Works directly in the browser (no app installation)

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard
- 🗺️ Live visualization of SOS alerts on Google Maps
- 📄 Persistent SOS alert logs (stored locally)
- ⏱️ Timestamped emergency records
- Clear separation between **user actions** and **security monitoring**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Modern UI, Dashboard Layout)**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Google Maps JavaScript API**
- **Browser LocalStorage** (for persistence)

> No backend or cloud services required for the prototype.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User opens the SmartSafe Campus web app
2. Location is detected (or entered manually)
3. User saves an emergency contact
4. On pressing **SOS**:
   - Location is pinned on the campus map
   - Alert is logged in the admin dashboard
   - Emergency contact receives a message with a live location link
